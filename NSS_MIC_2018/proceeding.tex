\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}


% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
\usepackage{smartdiagram}
\usesmartdiagramlibrary{additions}
\usepackage{cleveref}
\usepackage{booktabs} % Allows the use of \toprule, \midrule and \bottomrule in table
\usepackage{xspace,upgreek}
\usepackage{units_definitions}
\usepackage{tikz}
\usepackage{subfig}

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

The physics aims at the electron-positron option for  the Future Circular Collider FCC-ee, impose high precision requirements on the vertex and tracking detectors.  The detector has also to match the experimental conditions such as the collisions rate and the presence of beam-induced backgrounds.
A light weight tracking detector is under investigation for the IDEA (International Detector for Electron-Positron Accelerator) detector concept and consists of a drift chamber. Simulation studies of the drift chamber using the FCCSW (FCC software) are presented. Full simulations are used to study the effect of beam-induced backgrounds on this detector.

\section{Introduction}
The FCC-ee high-luminosity circular electron-positron collider, with center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s}$ from $91.2\,\gev$ to
$365\,\gev$, allows for high-precision measurements of the properties of the Z, the W, the top quark and the Higgs boson. As a predecessor of a new $100\,\tev$ proton-proton collider, the FCC-ee collider is foreseen to be placed in a 100~km tunnel. The IDEA detector, one of the two detector concepts under development for FCC-ee, has demanding requirements to match the experimental conditions. Its main components consist of: an ultra-light silicon-based vertex detector, an ultra-light drift chamber for track reconstruction and particle identification, a double-readout calorimeter, a 2~T solenoid magnetic field and an instrumented return yoke. The drift chamber is being investigated using \textsc{Geant4}-based simulations. Its performance and the effect of beam-induced backgrounds are presented here-below.


\section{Drift chamber}
The parameters of the drift chamber for the IDEA detector is summarized in \cref{driftChamberParams}. A gas, composed of $90~\%$ of Helium and $10~\%$ of isobutane ($\text{C}_{4}\text{H}_{10}$), is foreseen to be used. The average stereo angle of 0.1~radians allows for a longitudinal resolution of 1~mm.

\section{Simulation with the FCC Software}

The FCC Software (FCCSW)~\cite{FCCSW} is a common software for all FCC experiments. It is based on the Gaudi software framework~\cite{Gaudi} for parallel data processing, \textsc{Geant4} simulation toolkit~\cite{Geant4} and the DD4hep detector description toolkit for high energy physics~\cite{DD4hep}. The FCCSW simulation pipeline is summarized in \cref{simu_chain} and described here-below.

	  	}
  	}
\caption{The FCCSW simulation chain.}
\label{simu_chain}
\end{figure}




\subsection{Geometry description with DD4hep}
First, the geometry of the detector is described using the DD4hep simulation framework. The implementation of the detectors in the interaction region for the IDEA detector is shown in \cref{fig_sim}. The interaction region consists of a beam pipe, a shielding solenoid, a luminosity calorimeter, a vertex detector and a drift chamber. The geometry of the drift chamber is defined as layers of gas. In order to increase the simulation speed, the individual wires are not physically placed in the simulation software and the segmentation takes them into account.

	\end{scope}
	\end{tikzpicture}

\caption{The detectors at the interaction region for the FCC-ee IDEA concept as implemented in FCCSW.}
\label{fig_sim}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Segmentation}

The segmentation of the sensitive gas detector contains the information on the positions of the wires in the detector. The segmentation for the first layer of the drift chamber is shown in \cref{fig_segmentation_first_case}.

\begin{figure}[!t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{figures/allHits}
	\caption{The segmentation of the first layer of the drift chamber.}
	\label{fig_segmentation_first_case}
\end{figure}

The total number of wires as a function of the polar angle $\theta$ is illustrated in \cref{fig_segmentation_second_case}.

\begin{figure}[!t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{Poster/Figures/numWires}%
	\caption{Total number of wires as a function of the polar angle $\theta$ (calculated using infinite momentum tracks from the origin).}
	\label{fig_segmentation_second_case}
\end{figure}


\subsection{\textsc{Geant4} simulation and digitization}
\textsc{Geant4} simulates the passage of particles through matter. For the drift chamber simulation, a step size of 2~mm is chosen in order to step trough the gas volume and calculate the energy deposited. The ionization charge is then drifted to the nearest wire. This allows for calculating the drift time and therefore the signal in the wires. Once the contribution from each \textsc{Geant4} step is calculated, the digitization step regroups the energy deposited with a drift time smaller than the maximum drift time in the cell.

\section{Impact of beam-induced backgrounds}
One of the main sources of background at the FCC-ee experiments is generated from the strong electromagnetic force from the electron and positron bunches in the field of the opposite beam. This leads to the production of Beamstrahlung photons. The interactions of Beamstrahlung photons generate incoherent lepton pairs at low polar angles and mostly contained in the forward direction as shown in~\cref{fig_pairbcg}. The \textsc{GUINEA-PIG}~\cite{Schulte:382453} event generator has been used to generate the incoherent $e^+e^-$ background particles at a $\sqrt{s}$ of $365\,\gev$~\cite{Voutsinas:2017eca} and their impact on the drift chamber is studied below.


\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{figures/pairs_R_Z.png}
\caption{The trajectory of the $e^+e^-$ pairs in a 2~T magnetic field.}
\label{fig_pairbcg}
\end{figure}

The occupancy due to $e^+e^-$ incoherent pairs in the drift chamber is estimated to $\sim2.85\%$ (averaged over 100 bunch crossings). In fact, the produced incoherent pairs have a low polar angle and only few of them reach the drift chamber. Most of the hits observed are due to the scattering of the $e^+e^-$ pairs by interacting with the elements in the interaction region.

% \centering
% \includegraphics[width=2.5in]{figures/layerR_vs_phi}
% \caption{The detectors at the interaction region for the FCC-ee IDEA concept.}
% \label{fig_simhits}
% \end{figure}

\cref{occupancy_DCH} summarizes the occupancy in the drift chamber due to different sources of beam-induced backgrounds. The occupancy of the drift chamber as a function of its radius is shown in~\cref{fig_simhitspercent}. The overall occupancy due to this background remains low and does not pose problems for the reconstruction of the tracks using the drift chamber.

\centering
\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{Poster/Figures/incoherent_top_Z.pdf}
\caption{The percentage of wires hit due to $e^+e^-$ background as a function of the layer radius averaged over 100 bunch crossings. For the Z stage ($\sqrt{s} = 91.2\,\gev$), the readout latency is also taken into account by summing up the background over 4 bunch crossings.}
\label{fig_simhitspercent}
\end{figure}

	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l c c}

		 Background & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Average occupancy} \\
			& $\sqrt{s}$ = 91.2~GeV & $\sqrt{s}$ = 365~GeV \\
		 \midrule
		 $e^+e^-$ pair background & 1.1\% & 2.9\% \\
		 $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow$ hadrons & 0.001\% & 0.035\%  \\

	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Conclusion}
The drift chamber for the IDEA detector concept has been investigated in full simulations using the FCCSW. The full simulation chain has been implemented and validated using this common software and the impact of one of the most important beam-induced backgrounds due to the incoherent $e^+e^-$ pairs has been investigated in simulations. The overall impact remains low and remains promising for the track reconstruction with this detector.
